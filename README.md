# Rockbuster Stealth SQL Analysis

This repository features an SQL-based analysis of Rockbuster Stealth's business data, aimed at addressing key questions from the management team regarding their strategy. The analysis covers several important areas, including identifying which movies contributed most and least to revenue, analyzing average rental durations, mapping customer locations, tracking lifetime value trends, and examining sales variations across different regions. SQL queries were used to extract and process the data, uncovering valuable insights. These findings were then visualized to provide clear and actionable recommendations for Rockbuster's management.
